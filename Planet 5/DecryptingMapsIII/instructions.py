YCW Space Station Task 1: DecryptingMapsIII

You've finally landed on the YCWSS! Luckily for you, you know this place so well, you don't even need a map. However, you do need to guide the citizens of the District of Krieg, and so you start navigate your way to the center

To open many of the doors, you must decrypt the serial code hidden in the back of the terminal. Luckily, you know what this is!

1.) Remove all special characters from the serial code
2.) Reverse the first half of the code
3.) Reverse the second half of the code

You know for sure that all the serial codes have an even amount of characters. That helps a lot!
'''


serial_code = "a*^c&e@$k"
'''
Example 1:
1.) Removing all the special characters (there are 5) leaves you with "acek"
2.) Reversing the first half will be "ca", the second half will be "ke", and together it will be "cake"!
'''


serial_code = "###m#ed#e#s####i"
'''
Example 2:
1.) Remove all special characters to get "medesi"
2.) Reversing the first half will be "dem", the second half will be "ise", and together it will be "demise"!
