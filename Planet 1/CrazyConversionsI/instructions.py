Proxima Task 1: CrazyConversions

You've made it to Proxima! You land near an industrial city, with tall skyscrapers and sprawling roads, in search of Mr. Sashrey, a business man that might be able to help you with supplies for this interplanetary journey.

Mr. Sashrey can only help you once you stop Dr. Liberty! First you will need some gear, but since you forgot your payment card, you look for any loose change that you might have in your pockets or in your bag. However, you only have a couple of coins in YCWSS currency used within the YCW Space Station. What a fiasco!

Mr. SaShrey tells you that the intergalactic currency (IG) is 6.23 times the amount of YCWSS currency and the currency of Proxima (PX) is 0.79 times the amount of the intergalactic currency.

Your task is to convert your YCWSS (float) into IG, then convert that back into PX. ROUND PX to two decimal places.
'''

ycwss_1 = 100
'''
Example #1: 

You have 100 YCWSS. Converting YCWSS into IG results in 623 IG. Converting 623 IG into PX (Proxima's currency) results in 492.17 PX. 

Therefore 100 YCWSS is equivalent to 492.17 PX and you would return 492.17!
'''


ycwss_1 = 55.20
'''
Example #2: 

You have 55.20 YCWSS. Converting YCWSS into IG results in 343.896 IG. Converting 343.896 IG into PX (Proxima's currency) results in 271.67784 PX. Rounding this value to two decimal places results in 271.68 PX.

Therefore 55.20 YCWSS is equivalent to 271.67 PX and you would return 271.68!
