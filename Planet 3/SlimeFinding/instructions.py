New Krief Task 2: SlimeFinding

You finally reach the center of this annoying cave system. You see a huge lake of slime, cluttered with random objects. Some of them look useful, such as some weapons. As you stare across the slime cave, you see your batteries!

You are tasked with searching through the SLIME_LAKE (represented by a string with many words seperated by spaces) and return the number of batteries in the slime lake (represented by the word "battery")
'''



SLIME_LAKE_1 = "slime slime slime battery slime slime gun slime slime wrench slime battery slime slime slime wrench battery"

'''
Example #1: 

In this string there are many piles of slime and even a couple of wrenches and a gun, but what we are looking for is the number of occurances of the word "battery"

In this case, there are three occurances of the word "battery", so we return the integer 3
'''



SLIME_LAKE_2 = "slime slime can can slime slime can slime can slime wires slime skull slime slime gun slime slime wrench"

'''
Example #2: 

This slime lake has no occurances of "battery", so simply return the integer 0
